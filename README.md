Project one of Unit one

User Story
---------------
User will be able to shift tiles in directions to add up variables of the same amount. Variables will then be added up frequently while randomly assigning two new more values to the board. Goal is to get to the number 2048.
2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.
